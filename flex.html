			<p>You’re probably already familiar with automated testing and its benefits. Having a set of tests for your application allows you to make changes to your code with confidence, knowing that the tests have your back should you break anything. It’s possible to take things a step further and write your tests before you write the code; a practice known as Test-driven development (TDD).</p>

			<h3>What is TDD?</h3>
<p>Test-driven development is a programming methodology with which one can tackle the design, implementation, and testing of units of code, and to some extent the expected functionality of a program.</p>
<p>Complementing the test-first approach of Extreme Programming, in which developers write tests before implementing a feature or a unit, TDD also facilitates the refactoring of code; this is commonly referred to as the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle.

			<h3>Immediate test coverage</h3>
			<p>By writing test cases for a feature before its implementation, code coverage is immediately guaranteed, plus behavioral bugs can be caught earlier in the development lifecycle of a project. This, of course, necessitates tests that cover all behaviors, including error handling, but one should always practice TDD with this mindset.</p>

			<h3>Refactor with confidence</h3>
			<p>Referring to the red-green-refactor cycle above, any changes to an implementation can be verified by ensuring that the existing tests continue to pass. Writing tests that run as quickly as possible will shorten this feedback loop; while it’s important to cover all possible scenarios, and execution time can vary slightly between different computers, authoring lean and well-focused tests will save time in the long term.</p>
